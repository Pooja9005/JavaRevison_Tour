        <h2>Question 1</h2>
        <p>What is the util classes in Java</p>

        <ul>
            <li>These classes typically contain static methods that perform generic operations, such as data manipulation, string processing, mathematical calculations, input/output handling, date/time operations, and more</li>

            <li>Utility classes are designed to provide reusable functionality that can be used across different parts of an application or by multiple applications</li>
            <li>They aim to simplify common programming tasks and promote code reusability, maintainability, and readability</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Here are some characteristics of utility classes in Java:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Static Methods</b> Utility classes usually have static methods, allowing them to be accessed without instantiating an object of the class.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Stateless</b>Utility classes are generally stateless, meaning they don't maintain any instance variables or object state. They operate solely based on the input parameters passed to their methods.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Final and Non-instantiable</b>Utility classes are often marked as final to prevent subclassing, as their functionality is meant to be used directly. Additionally, they typically have a private constructor, making them non-instantiable.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Namespace</b>Utility classes are often placed within a specific package, such as java.util, org.apache.commons, or a custom package like com.example.util, to group related utility functions together.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Common Functionality:</b>Utility classes can offer a wide range of functionality depending on their purpose, including string manipulation, file handling, collection manipulation, conversion utilities, random number generation, regular expression matching, and more.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            What is generics.
            <ul>
                <li> generics allow you to create reusable components that can work with different types. Generics provide a way to parameterize classes, interfaces, and methods, allowing them to operate on a variety of data types without sacrificing type safety.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Type Safety:</b> Generics provide compile-time type checking, ensuring that the appropriate data types are used in a type-safe manner. This helps to catch potential type-related errors at compile-time rather than at runtime</li>
            <li><b>Code Reusability:</b> By using generics, you can create generic classes, interfaces, and methods that can be reused with different types. This promotes code reuse and eliminates the need for duplicating code for each specific type.</li>
            <li><b>Abstraction:</b> Generics allow you to write code that is more abstract and flexible, as it can work with multiple types. This helps to create generic algorithms and data structures that are not tied to specific data types.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        Important:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To use generics in Java, you typically use type parameters, denoted by angle brackets (<>), when declaring a class, interface, or method. The type parameter represents a placeholder for a specific type that will be provided when using the generic component</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Question No. 2</h2>
            <p>define this package in java AssetInfo</p>

            <ul>
                <li> packages are used to organize and group related classes and interfaces. The package name typically follows a reverse domain name convention to ensure uniqueness. In this case, the package name is "com.dam.dto.AssetInfo".</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Breaking down the package name</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"com" typically refers to the top-level domain component, which could represent a company or organization.</li>
                <li>"dam" might be an abbreviation or identifier for a specific project, module, or subsystem within that company or organization.</li>
                <li>"dto" stands for "data transfer object," which is a design pattern commonly used to encapsulate data and transfer it between different layers or components of an application.</li>
                <li>"AssetInfo" is likely a class or interface name that pertains to asset information. It might contain fields, methods, or properties related to assets, such as their name, type, description, or any other relevant information.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
